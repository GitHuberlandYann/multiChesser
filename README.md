# multiChesser
Multiplayer game of chess on local network.

## Introduction
While working on the project [VOX](https://github.com/GitHuberlandYann/VOX.git), I figured it was time to implement multiplayer - on the local network - to it.
This project serves as sandbox for me to get my hand on the communication protocol before I break my cherished VOX. And what other game to implement than the best ever created ? It's CHESS time boys.
